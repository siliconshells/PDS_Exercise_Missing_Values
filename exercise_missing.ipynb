So you can't just use `min()` or `max()`. We'll discuss converting string variables into numbers in a future class."

As we'll discuss in later lessons, to get completely accurate estimates from the ACS we have to take into account how people were selected to be interviewed.

The US Census treats Hispanic respondents as a sub-category of \"White.\" While all ethnic distinctions are socially constructed, and so on some level these distinctions are all deeply problematic, this coding is inconsistent with what most Americans think of when they hear the term \"White,\" a term *most* Americans think of as a category that is mutually exclusive of being Hispanic or Latino (categories which are also usually conflated in American popular discussion). With that in mind, most researchers working with US Census data split \"White\" into \"White, Hispanic\" and \"White, Non-Hispanic\" using `race` *and* `hispan`. But for the moment, just identify \"White\" respondents using the value in `race`.\n",
